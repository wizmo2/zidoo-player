## Services

### Search

The Search Media service can be used in conjunction with the SEARCH shortcut to display filtered results in the Media Browser based on a keyword.

* Use the query_string field to set the keywork seach for the entity.
* Use the Media SEARCH shortcut to display the results. You can also use a navigate action to `/media-browser/<media_player>/video%2Csearch`

The url `http://<ip_address>:<port>/media-browser/media_player.zidoo_z9s/video%2Csearch=<keyword>` can be used to display results of the search directly.

NOTE:  With a combination of helpers and scripts, it is possible to automate this function using the current lovalace versions, but this is essentially a development project for when a search function is incoperated into the Media Browser standard functions.
