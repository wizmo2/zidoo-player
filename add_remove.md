## Fixing HACS download problems

An issue with the HACS configuration file was introduced in release versions 1.2.4 and below, which prevents Versions from downloading correctly.

v1.2.5 fixes the issue, but if a previous version had been installed the following procuedure is required to add and remove the HACS install.

_NOTE:  Older versions have been re-built and re-released with the correct HACS configuration file to prevent ongoing issues (using 'v' prefix to the tags)_
